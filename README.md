> Create stage plots in draw.io using StagePlotPro assets

StagePlotPro was a highly regarded tool among stage engineers and live band performance teams, celebrated for its simplicity and efficiency. Unfortunately, its creator, [Albert Francis, may have passed away](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1700war/is_stageplotpro_dead/) (may he rest in peace), and the official purchase channels have been discontinued, making this excellent software inaccessible.

To continue its vital role in live performance work, we have ported the original software's image assets to draw.io. This modern solution allows users to create professional stage plots while honoring and preserving the legacy of StagePlotPro.
