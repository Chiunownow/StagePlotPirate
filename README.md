>  Create stage plots in draw.io using assets from StagePlotPro



StagePlotPro was a beloved tool for stage engineers and live band performance teams. Unfortunately, its creator, [Albert Francis, may have passed away](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1700war/is_stageplotpro_dead/) (may he rest in peace), and the official purchase channels are no longer available. As a result, this outstanding software is no longer accessible.



To preserve its valuable contribution to live performances, we have ported the original softwareâ€™s image assets to draw.io. This allows users to continue creating professional stage plots using a modern platform, honoring and extending the legacy of StagePlotPro.
